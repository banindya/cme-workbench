# CME Workbench
A DevOps toolkit for kubernetes on AWS. The workbench makes processes in a microservice world visible for developers in a non-console way.
CME is short for Consort Microservice Experience.

The toolkit is build for a medium to large size microservice setup with more than one team working in local, dev and production environments.

The toolkit addresses some of the **real world challenges** like 
- cloud security, 
- automated documentation, 
- advanced testing, 
- tool integration and 
- cost control.
