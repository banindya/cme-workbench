# CME Workbench
A DevOps toolkit for kubernetes on AWS. The workbench makes processes in a microservice world visible for developers in a non-console way.
CME is short for Consort Microservice Experience.

The toolkit is build for a medium to large size microservice setup with more than one team working in local, dev and production environments.

The toolkit addresses some of the **real world challenges** like 
- cloud security, 
- automated documentation, 
- advanced testing, 
- tool integration and 
- cost control.

<div class="warning">
CME Workbench is advanced tooling and requires some time to adapt to your infrastructure! For example the UI is secured by JWTs issued by a state-of-the-art IAM service as well as any services involved.
</div>

## What is it good for?

CME Workbench is a Angular UI with several backend microservices. The UI is used by DevOps staff to tackle daily challenges ranging from "create a new microservice" to "calculate the monthly costs for project XY".

The Workbench connects otherwise independent products to speed up the DevOps livecycle. It adds metadata around a set of microservices and forms the base for complex use cases (like documenting data flows for German DSGVO aka "Verzeichnis von Verarbeitungst√§tigkeiten").

The Workbench provides 30% of all use cases for an enterprise level project. Your team can enhance the toolkit with own microservices and Angular Components.

**There is no commercial version of the toolkit and there are no licenses or fees.**

## Technical requirements

You should have access to at least one Kubernetes cluster as well as a AWS account.

![basic setup](https://github.com/consort-it/cme-workbench/blob/master/img/setup.PNG)

Typically you have a lot of tooling already in place. We provide a set of tooling adapters for the most common services like GitLab or Jenkins. Because **all components are open source** you can adapt the workbench to any DevOps configuration.

There is no setup necessary apart from installing the adapters in a separate Kubernetes namespace and a AWS Cognito Userpool. You can even run the CME Workbench UI locally.

## Directory of components

The CME workbench is composed of the following components:

Component | Description | Required
------------|----------|-------------
[Angular UI](https://github.com/consort-it/cme-workbench) | The user interface, can be started without any backend service for demo purposes | yes
[GitLab Adapter](https://github.com/consort-it/gitlab-adapter) | Creates microservices in new GitLab/GitHub repositories | no
[Kubernetes Adapter](https://github.com/consort-it/kubernetes-adapter) | Reads runtime configuration from any Kubernetes Cluster | recommended
[Jira Adapter](https://github.com/consort-it/jira-adapter) | Reads tasks from Jira | no
[Confluence Adapter](https://github.com/consort-it/confluence-adapter) | Used by Jenkins job to update documentation pages | no

## Demo application

The demo application is composed of several components to create a **timesheet app** (an angular app with some backend services and authentication):

Component | Description | Docker-Container
----------|-------------|------------------
Timesheet UI | An Angular 5 app to enter and query data | [docker](https://jfrog.io)
Timesheet backend | A Java 8/Spark microservice which stores data in a AWS RDS PostgresSQL DB | [docker](https://jfrog.io)
Execel exporter | A message driven microservice which sends exported data via eMail | [docker](https://jfrog.io)
Synthetic test | A Cucumber powered containerized integration test which is meant to be run continuously to monitor core processes of the timesheet app | [docker](https://jfrog.io)
